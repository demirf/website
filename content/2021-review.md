Hello again after a year! I've been sharing my journey, goals, and achievements for 6 years. I started this series for just blogging purpose but I see it makes me very motivated for the next advantures. This year has been a good year overall, where I focused more on myself and did a lot of things. I also experienced many things for the first time. Here are the reviews for my journey and goals for 2021.

## Work Life üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

<!-- ![desk-setup](/blog/desk-setup-2021.jpg) -->

After graduating from university, I was able to focus fully on my job this year. In Jan 2021, I joined the [iyzico](https://www.iyzico.com/). I contributed to both web and mobile applications here and I had a small very friendly team. After working with small companies, iyzico was a good experience for me to work with many people and teams. Pair programming, collaboration, code reviews, test driven development, etc. I experienced many things here for the first time.

‚ö°Ô∏è During the time, I was working on open-source projects like always. I finished one of my favorite projects [React Native Hold Menu](https://github.com/enesozturk/react-native-hold-menu) and shared it with the community. Many people liked and shared it. Thanks to this project, I had a chance to meet and work with many people (special thanks to [Gorhom](https://github.com/gorhom) for helping me to solve some important problems). After a while, I got a message from a person who we follow on Twitter each other. He told me that he liked the project a lot. And he offered me a job. After talking about the details of the job I accepted and joined the [Qooper](https://qooper.io/). I had experienced several interviews and solved test cases, I have to tell that they can be very stressful. After I accept the job, they did not send me a test case. Because they already saw my code. It is really great advantage and of getting a job offer from the open source!

## Kodluyoruz üéô

This year I tutored for the first time with [Kodluyoruz](https://www.kodluyoruz.org/). It is a company that organizes boot camps for people who want to learn to code for free. They offered me to join them as an instructor and I thought it would be a good experience. I taught JavaScript and React to awesome 30 people. After one and half months almost every one of them completed their journey with a certificate and they developed great projects. Some of them started working with companies. Being part of such things is great motivation for me.

## Paragliding

<!-- ![paragliding](/blog/paragliding-2021.jpeg) -->

To be able to continue my paragliding career and fly more, I turned back to Sakarya after getting full-time job with my girlfriend. Here, I flew as many as possible.

üí• In good weather conditions, I pushed my limits and tried acro maneuvers. One of them went wrong.. I crashed for the first time after 5 years in paragliding. When I do a maneuver (helico) I lost all the altitude and did not realize it. I found myself on top of a tree. üå≤ Huh, hopefully, I was ok.

I also went to Oludeniz, Muƒüla several times to fly there to improve myself, this place is one of the best for paragliding in the world. And, for the next year, I will be there for a long time!

## That question üíç

<!-- ![wane](/blog/wane-2021.jpeg) -->

After more than 4 years we spent together, I asked a question to my best friend, who is the funniest, most beautiful person I know. I was really too excited. I am not good at organizing such things, did not know how to do that exactly until two days ago. When we were in Oludeniz, I decided to sail to beautiful bays with our favorite üçï and wine ü•Ç. When the sunset I thought I can ask it ü§≠ Everything went awesome than I expected. And just a few minutes before the sunset, in the middle of the sea, I asked her. Aaaanddd, she said yess!

Beside of these, of course I had many good and bad memories this year. Thankfully, everything goes great and excided from now for the next adventures. Now, lets see what happened to my goals for 2021. üëáüèΩ

# Goals üéØ

## Habits

- [x] **üìó Read 15 books at least**

Well, I made it double! I finished more than 30 books this year. But I am mostly listening to books. At the beginning of the year, I was living alone and doing many things alone, walking, cleaning home, cooking, etc. While I do these, I always listen to a book. Of course, I have read some of them. I don't have a habit to read books, trying to get that habit by reading some e-books but still leaving them after a while. I will definitely try to read more.

- [ ] **üö∂üèª Walk 100k per month**

One of the things I could not make it. Just before 21 and at the beginning of 21, I was walking regularly every day. I thought I can do it 100k per month. Somehow I stoped walking regularly. One of the reasons for it was my surgery. In February 2021, I had surgery on my left leg. It made it impossible to do it for a long time. But you know it is an excuse. After getting better, I did not care about this goal.

- [x] **ü§î Take self-criticize regularly**

This was the best thing I have ever done in these goals. Definitely. None of us is perfect and will never be. I have some problems with my emotional moods and relations. To fix these, I decided to make self-criticise regularly, write my emotions, what happened and what I did for them etc. This habit allowed me to see and fix some problems in my life. I could not make it regularly but made it several times. It was so helpful.

- [x] **üí∞ Get better at finance and invest regularly**

I was really bad at finance. I had not enough information about investment types, stock markets, economic changes, and the most important term: money. Investing smartly makes you be retired earlier than you think. I decided to get better at it and should invest regularly and smartly. I have [read some books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/102775572-enes-zt-rk?shelf=read) to get started. Now I will be focused more on some intermediate-level topics.

## Tech

- [x] **üß™ Get better in TDD for React & React Native**

I developed many applications with React and React Native until now. But testing is an important thing to make our applications safer and feel confident. Until 2021, I did not write fully tested applications. I put myself a goal about it. And after that, I worked on the applications which we write tests for both units, integrations, and end-to-end tests. I still have lots of things to learn and improve my techniques. I will continue to this goal. It is not 'done' but I put a checkmark on it for now.

- [x] **üÉè Get better in Reanimated**

I kinda got better at it. Reanimated is one of the greatest packages in React Native powered with JSI architecture. I always like good interactions and animations on applications. I developed React Native Hold Menu with Reanimated and also tried to create similar animations/interactions with it. Also, [Gesture Handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler) is the best friend of Reanimated which developed by the same company. You should check it out!

- [x] **üì¶ Publish React Native Hold Menu**

I [published it](https://twitter.com/enesozt_/status/1367894631346810882)! It was really challenging project for me. The thing I tried to build somehow was hard to work perfectly on both Android and iOS and I tried to solve different problems throughout the project.

Here, there is a fun fact; thanks to this project, my efforts, and people who helped me on this project (especially [Gorhom](https://github.com/gorhom)), I found my first global company (which I am currently working with). Actually, they found me. Our team leader saw my sharing on Twitter and told me he is impressed, asked me if I can work with them. This is very motivating! Another little big detail is that they did not send me a test case. Because they already saw my coding skills, what I've done until now. After experiencing some interviews with test cases, I saw that it is a very stressful process and understand the importance of this advantage very well.

- [x] **üé® Improve design skills**

I did not create great designs but Figma is my second best friend. I always try to design my ideas with inspiration from the community. Here you can check my profile. I shared some designs from my work.

> Also worth the mention, many of these goals are not finishable but I feel I reached my goals. That is why I put checkmark but will definitely continue them.

## Paragliding Acro ü™Ç

I have a mini career in paragliding. I am trying to be an aerobatics pilot. It is the hardest path on the paragliding but most adrenalin way! I love to do some maneuvers on air. I was able to do just a few of them this year. To improve yourself in this path, you should fly hours, practice many many many times. Like anything else, you need to spend your time a lot. I do not have to rush, still have some maneuvers for next year ü§òüèΩ
